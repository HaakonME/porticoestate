Description of the Templates used by CVSWeb
-------------------------------------------

Each of the HTML template files control a portion
of the HTML output by the CVSWEB script.  You should edit
them to customise it to your site's needs.

Note that although most of the code has been abstracted
out into the PHP scripts, some remains in the templates,
and you can spot this by the <? ?> tags.  Do not edit anything
within those tags, or you risk breaking the script!

There are three main types of pages in the script - 
the directory view (dir_*), the revision menu (diff_*),
and the human-readable-diff (hr_*).  Overall characteristics
are controlled by the page_* files.

* page_footer.inc
* page_header.inc

  These control the header and footer HTML, such as the
  <head> tag.  These are often replaced with whatever
  PHP functions you use to 'wrap' the CVS output.

* diff_header.inc

  This controls the top output of the diff menu, such
  as the toolbar at the top, and branch information.

* diff_rev.inc

  This lists the change details of each revision, including
  number of lines changed, and links to human-readable diffs,
  and author/date information.

* diff_request.inc

  This is the form at the bottom of the diff screen, which
  lets users make diffs against arbitrary versions/tags.

* dir_header.inc
* dir_footer.inc

  These are included at the top and bottom of the directory
  listing, and show introductory text, and the clickable
  path view.

* dir_back.inc
* dir_directory.inc
* dir_file.inc

  Each of these is an individual line in the directory list,
  for the relevant type of file (.., dir/, or file)
  Each displays an icon and links to the relevant page for
  that type of file.

* error_page.inc

  This is the page that is shown upon a fatal error, such
  as permission denied, binaries not being executed, etc.

* hr_diff_footer.inc
* hr_diff_header.inc

  The header and footer for the Human-Readable Diff view
  which has version information and sets up the table.

* hr_diff_add.inc

  Row to show when a line has been added in the diff.

* hr_diff_change.inc

  Row to show when a line has been changed in the diff.

* hr_diff_remove.inc

  Row to show when a line has been removed in the diff.

* hr_diff_empty.inc

  Row to show for context, when the line hasnt been changed.

* hr_diff_nochange.inc

  Row to show when there is no viewable change between the
  two versions being diff'ed.

* hr_diff_row.inc
