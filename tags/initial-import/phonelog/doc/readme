Hi,

welcome to the phonelog addon for phpgroupware. This application is meant to help you and your coworkers track incoming calls. You can use it to quickly enter a note for your collegue that John from company John Incorporated called, and that your collegue needs to call back urgently, for instance. The application is designed to help you, so if you only heard the company name and part of the name of the caller, you can quickly lookup all know contacts for that company.
This application has been terribly neglected by me. I do apologize. I'm working on updating this app asap. For now it will be based on phpgroupware api 0.9.10pre16

-- Latest version :
the latest version of this addon is available through cvs at the phpgroupware addon page at sourceforge :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpgwapps/
You could also check www.playcollective.com/mathieu. If it doesn't exist, I haven't set it up yet :)

-- Installation

Prerequisites :
- phpgroupware 0.9.10pre16 (might not work on later versions)
- mysql (hasn't been tested on postgresql/oracle, but it might work on those as well)
- (NOT necessary) timetrack add-on (needed for company listings)

Step 1.
download the phonelog.tgz file and unzip it with
# tar xzf phonelog.tgz
or download the phonelog folder from cvs at sourceforge
(you've probably already done this since you're reading this file)

Step 2.
Place the phonelog folder in the phpgroupware folder.
feed the phonelog/doc/create_mysql.sql to mysql with something like
# mysql -ppassword -u mysqlusername phpgroupware < create_mysql.sql

This adds an entry to the applications table in phpgroupware. It also creates a table called phonelog_entry in the database, which will be used to store all calls.

Step 3.
edit the file phonelog/inc/header.inc.php
In this file the different status levels for a call are maintained.
(default is:
0->'no further action',
1->'will call back',
2->'call back' &
3->'call back - URGENT'.
Please note the application depends on a relation between the status number and the status level. A higher number indicates a higher priority.

Step 4.
Login to phpgroupware, and enable to phonelog application in the administration page.

This should be it. Send me an email if you run into trouble, or need a feature.
