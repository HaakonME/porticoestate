These are the list of goals that must be met before releasing
various CHORA versions.

------
 0.5 
------

o CVS Annotate support.

o Multiple Repository support via configuration files.

------
 0.9
------

o Correct support for MIME detection via Horde framework.

o Work with register_globals off.

------
 1.0
------

o Detect various CVSROOT config files such as ones for directory
  descriptions and so on.

o Better error handling for unusual RCS situations.

o Fully documented CVSLib via PHPDoc, and ensure API style 
  consistency.

o Perform security sweep to ensure that all variables are parsed
  sanely, and that the popen() etc are solid.

o (optional) work under Win32 if possible.  May prove a problem due
  to liberal use of popen()

o User interface evaluation and cleanup.

------
 1.1+
------

o External pretty-print support via GNU enscript and other utilities.

o Other utility support (lint support for C files, pod2html for perl,
  PHPDoc for PHP)

o Provide compressed versions of files/directories on a given tag,
  for downloading (might wait till version 2.x).

o Intelligent diff based on MIME type.  For example, if it is an image,
  then show the old and new version side-by-side.  Investigate engines
  other than plain-old-diff to see if they can do a better job.

------
 2.0+
------

o Provide a database and caching backend for advanced searching.

o Generate per-directory and per-repository visual branch views,
  instead of only per-file.

o Assign Commit IDs, and view all the changes in a given commit,
  instead of a given file.
