FAX module for phpgroupware
---------------------------

The author assumes that the user has sucessfully installed HylaFAX and is
able to send faxes, as no help for general setup will be provided.

WARNING: 
 - the module is still under development!
 - you'd have the 'convert' program from ImageMagick programs tools to
   preview the fax cover
 - to get the file from your storage space, you need the
   class.file_chooser.inc.php (patch/add for the filemanager/phpwebhosting
   module)

I wish to have feedback and bug reports to improve the module.
thank you in advance!
