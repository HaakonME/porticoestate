KNOWN ISSUES:
 1) snarf sites are slow (noaa, images, wunderground etc..)
 2) image not current...probably the browser...force a reload
    to ignore the cache
 3) I don't try to manage the relationship of metar regions
    to metar data.  If you delete a region, the metar data
    just won't show it/use it.
 4) The layout of the code is currently pretty nasty, but
    always improving:)
