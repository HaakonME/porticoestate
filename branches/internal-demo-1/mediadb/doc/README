# THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPT
# ALMOST TO THE POINT OF BEING A TODO LIST

# THIS APPLICATION IS ALPHA ... SOME FILES ARE MERELY
# PLACEHOLDERS FOR EVENTUAL CAPABILIES

# Need to add tighter control of permissions
# Have wrapped the admin functions with admin verification
# but preferences and index need limited to those with
# access (can enter the url for many of the apps whether
# provided or not and get the service)

# The media_data table needs modified to support
# multiple artists,distributors,genres, etc....

# Front page
#  displays tables for each with new/loaned/borrowed info
#  - highlights those due within X # days
#  catbar of categories
#  - movie/book/music/games/archives
#  actbar of actions
#  - list (requests/owned)
#  body
#  searchbar

# Core
#  has ability to add a new item (no ownership)
#  emails due date notices
#  ownership tables
#  ASIN or UPC codes are the media code (search
#   option for adding to ownership table...not
#   found leads to creation of new item
#  option for borrowed items to come from library
#  use view templates
#  manages a request table (an possible the email
#  x-type that Seek3r has set up)

# barcode reader
#  use a barcode reader to build database tables for
#  the media (pulling info from amazon.com/imdb/etc:)
#  (cool...scan what you have automagically into
#  system:)

# admin
#  add/edit/disable/enable categories (deletion may be too messy)
#  modify list tables - defaults (sort, width, visible, name)
#  artist,mfg/dist,media_data management (these are unowned tables) 

# preferences
#  categories enable/disable
#  modify list tables (sort, width, visible)
#  notices (front page/home page, type visible)
#  media, request, borrow management (these are owned tables)

# current database edit functions limitations
#  1) lists all on 1 page
#  2) does not remove cross reference data
