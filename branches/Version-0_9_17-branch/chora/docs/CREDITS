CVSWeb module:

Based on an perl script written by Bill Fenner <fenner@parc.xerox.com>,
and Human-Readable diff code by H. Zeller <zeller@think.de>

Charles Hagenbuch <chuck@horde.org> then did the initial port from
perl to PHP.

Anil Madhavapeddy <anil@recoil.org> cleaned it up, added template
support, figured it needed a rewrite.  And thus came along the CVSLib
library and the current incarnation of the viewer.

Inspiration for the annotation portions came from examining 
Bill Fenner's original cvsweb script again, and looking at the
'cvs server' implementation.
