10/08/2000: Initial Alpha release on sourceforge. Setup CVS and imported current
	codebase into it.
10/15/2000: Changes made last week (from memory): 
	1. Edited hr-profiles.php, jobslist.php, and inc/header.inc.php 
	to redo permissions scheme to allow anyone to add or edit jobs. Only thing
	still limited to Managers is job approval and complete access to employee
	profiles.
	2. Completed my new "newjobslist.php" file to replace "jobslist.php". This
	file still needs to be linked into the menu in place of jobslist.php. Using
	this page is dependent on changes I have made to inc/phpgwapi/phpgw_nextmatchs
	file (see #3). This page now has functionality like the addressbook index,
	limiting number of jobs per page and adding numerous filtering capabilities.
	3. Added 3 functions to inc/phpgwapi/phpgw_nextmatchs to add an expanded
	show_bytable() to use in place of show(). This function allows you to specify
	a db table to use for the filter dropdown and also to fill an array ($dbfields)
	for specifying which field to search on. show_bytable() and show_bytable_tpl()
	(for template based pages) call the new search_filter_by_table() function.
	I have included my modified copy of this file in the doc directory. It is
	compatible with the 0.9.1 beta release and upto the CVS version 1.13 of this
	file. Some other minor changes are needed to bring it upto par with the 1.14 release
	of the file. I have submitted the changes to seek3r for inclusion into the
	current code base.
	4. I have modified the addressbook code to allow anyone the ability to edit
	global public entries. This was done for our site to allow easy updating of
	the 600+ entries I had to import from another source, which was not complete.
	I plan on suggesting the addition of this code to the phpgroupware base soon.
	Includes patches to fix group assignment during adds and edits which were
	already posted.
	5. Modified the timesheets.php file to better sort the timesheet entries.
10/16/2000: 
	1. Changed header.inc.php to point menu to newjobslist.php instead of jobslist.php.
	2. added lang-ttrack-10162000.sql for additional lang entries.
	3. commited all changes to CVS on sourceforge.
10/17/2000:
	1. Added "IF NOT EXISTS" to timetrack.mysql because my customers table has been
	added to the main phpgroupware codebase in CVS.
	2. Change completed link in editjob.php to point to newjobslist.php instead of
	jobslist.php.
	3. Further editing editjob.php to support handing the needed (hidden) form vars
	back to newjobslist.php so as to preserve the set. Note that I don't think this
	works as it should yet in addressbook either.
	4. Fix the settings for Contact and Approved By selections in editjob.php. The
	variables were miss named. Per user suggestions, changed "Approved By" to "Assigned By".
	5. Removed the "Supervisor signature line from the printer friendly timesheet per
	management request.
10/18/2000:
	1. Updated newjob.php for changing "Approved By" to "Assigned By", changed "Select Manager"
	to simply "Select".
	2. Installed and tested on phpgroupware 0.9.2 release and created a new patch for
	phpgroupware/inc/phpgwapi/phpgw_nextmatchs.inc.php, updated INSTALL file for new release, etc.
	The provided patch has also been submitted to the phpgroupware patch manager on sourceforge
	as patch ID #101966.
	3. Update CVS for all these changes, deleting obsolete entries and adding new ones, etc.
10/26/2000:
	1. Add simple error checking to newjob.php.
	2. Alter the jobs table to make the status_id field "NOT NULL" and have a default of "0". This
	makes it so the setting is not required in the newjob page.
	3. Add menu entry to inc/header.inc.php for in/out page (index.php)
	4. Fixed problems with newjobslist.php and phpgw_nextmatchs.inc.php, submitted patch #102129
	to phpgroupware regarding phpgw_nextmatchs.inc.php, until it shows up, users will want to replace
	their current one with the one in the doc directory.
10/28/2000:
	1. Created admin and preference hook pages for supporting setup functions. Some admin pages
	have not been created yet. They will support editing the status, location and work_catagory
	tables. The preferences page currently only has one item, which allows the user to specify
	a size for the customer list dropdowns on the newjob and addjobdetail pages. You may not
	think this is necessary, but when one is using a unix browser that doesn't support scrollable
	dropdowns (popup menu instead), a scrollable listbox will replace it if set over 1, and it
	is especially useful if your customer list has a large amount of entries.
10/29/2000:
	1. Commited code submitted by Camden which creates a link on the newjobslist page under the
	total hours reported column to his "hourslist.php" page, which is supposed to list the
	detail entries for the job. There may be some issues with it to work out yet.
	2. Finished all the admin pages for the admin hooks.
	3. Had to change the status_id field of job_status to be auto_increment, which now also
	makes it necessary to change current job entries to reflect this. Should not be an issue
	for anyone without much job data yet.
11/02/2000:
	1. Work on incorporating a new Calendar based (and javascript) DatePicker widget and
	   a new TimeSelector widget I am developing by:
	   a. Added inc/Calendar1-3.js (authored by Kedar R. Bhave, free to use as long as Copyright
	      is left intact). I did make a few minor changes to it, documented in file header.
	   b. Updated inc/functions.inc.php to add php functions for accessing the CalDateSelector()
	      and created the new TimeSelect2() function. Still need to add code to this for validation.
	   c. Had to Alter the job_details table start_time field to be type time instead of type
	      timestamp. This makes the code more compatible with PostgreSQL.
	      Current users should be able to just re-import the update_jobs_table-001026.sql again
	      in order to change this field (once all the new files mentioned here are in place).
	      IMPORTANT NOTE: You apparently need to have MySQL 3.23.xx (I have 3.23.22b) for this
	      to NOT screw up your timestamp data.
	   d. Incorporate all the above changes into editdetail.php and addjobdetail.php.
	2. Created a new "detail_report1.php" page, accessible thru a form added to the viewjob page,
	   which also uses the new dateselector.
02/15/2001:
	Well, I have not been keeping good track of changes here, but mainly I have updated
	everything to work with the 0.9.9 release of Phpgroupware and have decided it is time
	to finally make a new release. I will try to recall some of the changes made over the last
	3 months here (in no particular order):
	1. Added more admin hook pages.
	2. Rework layout of pages for better consistency and common look with templates.
	3. Integrate contributed changes for allowing Payroll to view and edit everyone's timesheet.
	4. Integrated changes by Camden Spiller to allow more than one entry per job per day.
	5. Added option in customers table to specify if customer has active jobs. This limits
	   number of companies displayed when adding job_details or new jobs for better performance
	   when there are alot of customers in the database.
	6. Added an "Add as New" option to the edit job detail page to provide a method for copying
	   job details within the scope of the same job/employee.
	7. Reverse sort job number on "Enter Time" page so the newest job is picked by default.
	I think that pretty much covers the changes made over this time period. Please note that this
	release is still meant for expert only installation, and only with phpgroupware 0.9.9
04/07/2001:
	Have still not been keeping track of changes like I should. I have recently completed
	(hopefully) all neccessary changes to get Time Tracker running on PhpGroupware 0.9.10.
	Among the mainly changes required were the following:
	1. Change all sql statements to match the new table and field name changes in core phpgroupware.
	   I also took this opportunity to change the timetrack specific tables to match the spec.
	   Note: This version defines again it's own customers table named "phpgw_ttrack_customers".
	   If a new install is being done, it will not migrate any data from the current customers
	   table. If a proper upgrade from earlier versions can be done, the current customers
	   table will be upgraded and renamed to the new version. However, unless special upgrade
	   code is added to phpgroupware that can migrate timetracks left joined company_id in the
	   customers table to an "org_name" in the phpgw_addressbook table, OR, if one can execute
	   the proper sql update query before upgrading phpgroupware to 0.9.10, current customer
	   names for contacts will be lost!
	2. Make changes to compensate for losing the company_id field in addressbook, allowing continued
	   use of being able top associate contacts with customer jobs.
	3. Change all $phpgw->link() calls to match the new requirement of full url path to links.
	4. Change $phpgw->nextmatchs->show() to echo $phpgw->nextmatchs->show_tpl().
	5. Implement changes in how groups and acls are handled.
	6. Fixed bug in customers.php and customers.tpl that caused numerous display related issues.
	   (2 patches were submitted, the one used was from Tim Oliver). Had to update his patches
	   to work with the new schema though.
	7. A Big one: I have developed a much better method of installing Timetracker which takes
	   all the hassles out of setting it up and even removing it. Will also help in upgrading
	   previous installations (upgrades not tested yet). There may still need to be more changes
	   here for the final release of 0.9.10. Setup defines the tables, adds some default data to 
	   them, add's timetrack to the applications table, add's default profiles for all user 
	   accounts, creates the TTrack_Manager and TTrack_Payroll groups and related acls, gives
	   all users the "run" acl for timetrack, adds default customer entries for each distinct
	   org_name in addressbook, and adds the lang entries for English. Further refinements
	   later on will make this process more flexible.
04/08/2001:
	1. Changed DROP TABLE statements in setup for removing Timetrack to add "IF EXISTS"
	   clause.
	2. Add account_pwd values to creation of TTrack_Managers and TTrack_Payroll groups,
	   setting the passwords to "*LK*" to symbolize Locked accounts, since it is impossible
	   to lonin as a group anyway? This was done to prevent sql errors since the field
	   is defined as not allowing NULL entries.
04/09/2001
	1. Updated setup process to use the phpgwapi as much as possible. Was able to use it
	   for everything except dealing with the applications and config tables. This obsoletes
	   Entry 2 for 4/8/2001.
	2. Updated 2 files to use PHPGW_SERVER_ROOT instead of $phpgw_info["server"]["server_root"]
	   and 2 other "hook" files to remove unneeded code for finding the app icon image, which
	   also referenced the old server_root var. Noted that the 2 hook files were actually
	   obsolete versions I left hanging around to support older versions of phpgroupware.
	3. Converted header.inc.php for Timetrack to use accounts api to check group membership.
	   This effectively removes the need to putting any values in phpgw_config, so I will be
	   getting rid of those next.
	4. Removed setup code that stored group id's in phpgw_config. Todo: Modify upgrade script
	   to remove these values, perhaps first renaming the appropriate group names to 
	   the new standard.
04/10/2001
	1. Removed access to the admin4 page, used for setting Manager and Payroll groups, since
	   we are basically using what amounts to dedicated groups anyway. Removeal was done by
	   simply commenting out the lines in inc/hook_admin.inc.php as we may want to add it back
	   in for other purposes later.
	2. editprofile.php has missing lang entries. Fix by adding entries to lang section 
	   for timetrack.
04/18/2001
	1. Completed transition to phpgwapi for all calls regarding contacts and accounts.
	2. For better clarity regarding addition of employee profiles, the "Edit Profiles"
	   page automatically creates default profiles for any accounts that don't have one
	   whenever it is accessed.
Next up:
	Test the ability of Timetrack to upgrade itself along with upgrading of phpgroupware
	0.9.10RC2

04/27/2001
	1. Have tested and tweaked timetrack's upgrade process, works now. It even has a check
	   on the index page that offers a link for admins to setup for the upgrade.
	2. Added some new fields to the jobs and job_details tables. total_hours in jobs table
	   is used to store the value of SUM(num_hours) from job_details, and this value is updated
	   whenever a detail is added, edited, or deleted. The jobslist page now uses this value
	   to display total hours worked instead of just ommiting it, resulting in greatly improved
	   performance while still maintaining the features. Other fields added are for marking
	   entries as being exported, including an export_timestamp, but these fields are not
	   yet implemented in code.
	3. Related to No. 2, I added code to the upgrade procedure to recalc total_hours values
	   for all currently entered jobs. Also in setup, I added an option to fix the addressbook
	   upgrade which does not spoil any existing data, contrary to the upgrade performed by
	   phpgroupware.
	4. Fixed bug on querying for contact names.
	5. Migrated the profiles page (EDit Profiles) to templates, loosely based on the
	   admin/accounts page.

At this point I feel it is time to release a test version.

05/24/2001
	1. Decision made yesterday to merge timetrack into main phpgroupware with blessings of
	   groupware admin Seek3r (Dan K.). Support request in to sourceforge to move timetrack
	   module from phpgwtimetrack project to phpgroupware cvs tree.
	2. During upgrade of production system last week, bug was discovered and fixed regarding
	   the fixcontacts process which wrongly tried to convert account logins to id's when
	   they were already id's from the main phpgroupware upgrade process to 0.9.9p1.
	3. Noticed a bug in which extra slashes are being added to comments in the editdetails
	   page. Look for fix. Appears to be because my new server had magic_quotes_gpc set to
	   On instead of Off as the old one did.
	4. Found new bugs due to changes in the final release of phpgroupware 0.9.10, relating
	   to setup. Fixed?
	5. Put together a last release for phpgwtimetrack project and upload to sourceforge.
	   Also commit these changes to cvs hopefully before they move the module on sf.
