Thanks goes to all these persons who have helped:

Kristian Kristensen <zianet@zianet.dk>
  He gave me the idea that it would be cool to have the current
  weather shown on a webpage. An idea might seam as a little thing,
  but remember that someone has to get the idea, or else things will
  never be done.

Jeremy D. Zawodny <Jeremy@Zawodny.com>
  For writing Geo::METAR where I found the logick needed in PHP
  Weather.

Enrico Lodolo <e.lodolo@bo.nettuno.it>
  For suggesting that I use http to get the metars instead of the much
  slower ftp.

Stefan Wiesendanger <stefan.wiesendanger@epfl.ch>
  For rewritting the large case- and switch-statements as a couple of
  arrays. This speeds-up the parsing of the metars.

Mike <bvrtrimmer@lycos.com>
  He noticed that the pressures was all wrong. I though the unit used
  in the metar was hPa, when it really was inHg.

Jeffrey Y. Sue <jysue@tiki.net>
  Suggested that I told people how to turn off the warnings, if you
  don't establish a connection to MySQL.
  Later he made it possible to use PHP Weather with DBM databases. He
  also added support for precipitation.
  Lots of other stuff, see ChangeLog for more details.

Rutger Lubbers <rutger@notenbomer.nl>
  Noticed that South/southeast was duplicated in the
  directions-array.

Gogo "the Great" "Bongo,,,,"" <great@great.sk>
  Added support for PostgreSQL.
