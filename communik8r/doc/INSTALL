Yes this is simple.  It assumes you know what you are doing.

If something is unclear tell me.

Here is the basic install instructions:
* Untar in your phpgw install directory
* Install thru setup like any other phpGW app
* Edit smtp_host in the top of inc/class.boemail.inc.php
* Grant yourself access
* Create an account for yourself using phpmyadmin (see note below)
* Apply contacts patch - see file in this dir
* Check your perms
* cp the htaccess file to .htaccess
* Cross your fingers
* Once loaded click on a folder to display its contents (hopefully)

Requirements
* An ability to think for yourself
* An ability to communicate problems
* A willingness to put up with some problems
* PHP 4.3.x (php-domxml and php-mbstring, php-pspell is optional)
* Firefox 0.8+ / IE 6 (if you must)
* PECL mailparse installed - see below
* These will get more flexible shortly

Installing PECL mailparse
The current version of communik8r doesn't rely on mailparse from PECL. 
This may change at any time so install it anyway, just incase.  It is pretty
easy to install.  First check your distro they might ship a pacakge for it, if
not install the php4-dev and php4-pear packages.  Then just run:
$ sudo pear install mailparse
It will then build and install the binary :)

Creating an account
Use this template
INSERT INTO phpgw_communik8r_accts(owner_id, acct_name, display_name,acct_uri, username, password, server, port, acct_type_id)
	VALUES(<phpgw_acct_id>, 'My Account Name', '<First LastName>','<myemail@ddress.com>', '<username>', '<plaintextpassword>','<mailserver>', '<port>', 1);

Enjoy :)
