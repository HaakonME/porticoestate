Hello phpGW,
Here is a note on how to set up Chora on NT or Windows 2000. I believe
an example like this as a simple installnt.txt file in the base
directory for Chora would help people using phpGW on NT or Windows 2000.

You might need to refer people to tutorials on CVS.

(You can install anything else you like, this is just the minimum for Chora.)
