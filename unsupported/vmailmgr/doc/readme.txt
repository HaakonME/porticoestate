WHAT IS THIS?: This addon app simply tries to keep
vmailmgr and phpgw accounts in sync.
You just create accounts in phpGW and this will also create the account
in vmailmgr. Likewide for deleting accounts and changing passwords.


INSTALLATION:
This app installs normally, but will not work 
unless you give the Default group rights to this app.
Then make sure ALL users are in the Default group to ensure that
changing passwords will work as expected.

!!!!!WARNING!!!!!
Right now the domain password is always stored as plain text. BEWARE!!
