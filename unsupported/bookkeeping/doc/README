Bookkeeping started on the 5th of march 2001 as a bookkeeping application for phpgroupware. After two months it became clear to me that a major rewrite was needed. On the 6th of may 2001 I started the rewrite.

The bookkeeping class I am writing should contain all variables and functions used for financial affairs.

The doc directory contains several files. These file are explained below:
- CHANGELOG contains, well ..., the changelog. 
- FEATURES contains the (stable) features of the present release.
- INSTALL contains information how to setup bookkeeping as part of phpgroupware. Currently, only MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported.
- OVERVIEW gives an schematic overview of the application.
- README is this file.
- TODO contains the featues which are sceduled for development, or are being developed.

If you have a question or remark you can always send me an e-mail at darw1n@users.sourceforge.net or drop by in the phpgroupware channel on IRC (OpenProjectsNet).
