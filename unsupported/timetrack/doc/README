This release of phpgwtimetrack is meant to be a developer's only release 
for compatibility (to an extent) with phpgroupware 0.9.10. Do not use this 
on a production system without testing it extensively first.

This developer's only release of Phpgwtimetrack is being made so developers 
can test it's operation, submit bug reports (and/or fixes). Most of the
functionality is preserved with the earlier version for phpgroupware 0.9.9.

Please see the INSTALL file for setup info.

The following text is from the last release and has been left in for
historical perspective:

This application (phpgwtimetrack) was developed initially for internal
use at my company. It was started when phpgroupware was still alpha code
and has been updated as new releases came out, currently it is compatible
with the 0.9.9 beta release of phpgroupware.

As my main job function here is Systems Administration, I am not sure how
much more time I can invest in developing this program for more general use,
so I am depending on alot of input from other developers to further improve
this application, and I can hopefully just manage the project for the most part.
I would rather work on programming than sys admin, so if I can keep my users
happy and have no major systems work, I am usually persuing some form of
programming activity.
