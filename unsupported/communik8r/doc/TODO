This is far from a comprehensive todo list.  I just add things here so I don't forget
* Add accounts management screen
* Add signature management screen
* Improve error handling on both client and server side
* Implement API logging framework
* Check for full i18n support
* Readd # of unread message to folder listings
* Auto refresh
* Fix client side table sorting - did work at some stage
