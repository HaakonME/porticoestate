There are a lot of people who deserve credit for this app.  Here is a rough 
list, sign me up for spam if i left you out ;)

Noah (my son)
Although I had the idea for this type of UI for a while, it was the mornings
immediately after Noah was born that I built a simple prototype.  The 
prototype was pretty simple but it showed what was possible

Julie Tisdale (my partner)
For putting up with all my sh!t.  Without your patience I would be stuck 
turning out crapola.com sites for some dodgy "web design" company.  Instead 
I create stuff like this, while the family suffers from malnutrition.

Adam Ballai, Plutonic Networks (http://plutonicnetworks.net)
For seeing the potential of the app and finding a sponsor

West USA Realty Inc (http://westusa.com)
For putting up the cash

Brian Johnson, Johnson Engineering (http://www.jecinc.on.ca/)
For helping me work out how to use sql_builder

The alpha testers Alex Borges, Guillaume Courtois, Andy Schiller, 
  Hsing-Foo Wang & Chris Weiss
Thanks for helping to get the major kinks out before the public got hold of it

Google (http://google.com)
You guys were on the right track with Gmail and Suggest, but you needed someone 
to really take it somewhere :P

Various GPL JavaSscript Developers
Thanks, you guys who saved me so much work.  See the js dir for the apps

Dean Edwards (http://dean.edwards.name)
For creating IE7 which saved me hours of head fucks!  I don't think M$ IE7
even come close.

Guido Wesdorp (http://debris.demon.nl)
For listening to me rant, bitch and moan about problems with AJAX.  Not
only did he save my sanity on a few occasions he has helped keep me
entertained.  If you like communik8r and are near Rotterdam.nl, drop
off some beers to Guido, I owe him.

Emmanouil Batsis (http://sarissa.sf.net)
Manos deserves 2 lots of credits, one for writing Sarissa which makes my 
pretty damm easy :)  Also for being a dev who is willing to engage in some
hand holding as needed.

Claudia Cepin (http://freesoul.cc)
For doing the flash animation for me
