This is a phpGroupWare-ized version of the Yahoo! User Interface Library.  

The original library is available from http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/.  

We have just copied some files to make it all work with the phpGW js class.  The original files from the zip (including docs) are in phpgwapi/js/yahoo/yui

If you are using this libraray outside of phpGroupware, please hassle Y! not 
us, we would like to take the credit for it, but unfortunately we can't as we didn't write it :)
